I would like to share a question which I often asked my grandmother, “What are you doing on this laptop?”. I am sure it is difficult for you also to explain what is web designing to your grandparents.

However, I found a way to explain the same by taking some real-life examples. Firstly, I was looking for something which I can relate to.

A construction site can be a perfect example, where core construction elements can play the role of different elements of programming.


![html](./html.png)

*HTML (Bricks): The way we build our pages using HTML, the same way we build building structures by using bricks. <html> is our foundation stone on which we build the whole structure of the page.*


![js](./js.png)

*JavaScript (Cement): Don’t forget bricks can’t build the structure alone we need another special element called Cement. With the help of cement, we can create meaningful structures. I can also add dynamic elements by using JavaScript like electricity boards, lights, etc.*


![css](./css.png)

*CSS (Paint): Since our main structure is ready now, we can now give it a good paint job. CSS plays a similar role in web designing, it provides colors to our web pages.*

I am sure you can also explain programming to your loved ones, especially if they are not from a programming background.
